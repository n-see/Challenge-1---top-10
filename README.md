Comments: Neo Like the images as the link and the carosuel of pokemons/yu-gi-oh as the top ten  Johnny's page to add some padding/margins from the title and navbar; have the images the same hieght so teh page doesn't keep changing.

Andrea "I love how rich and hi-res the graphics are. The use of the carousel for displaying the list items was really clever and made looking through them fun and engaging. I would probably have added some more color to the background but given how colorful all of the images are I can understand why you went with a simple black and grey palette. Nicely done!"
